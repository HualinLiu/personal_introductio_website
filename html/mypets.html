                So, I had and are having a lot of animals! Include but not 
                limited to: 7 hamsters, 4 fish, 1 bunny. 2.5 cats, 2 birds, 
                2 ducks, 2 chicken, 2 snails, and I don't know, like 20-30 silkworms.

                So in this page, I will only introduce my 2.5 cats(You will figure out 
                why there is a 0.5 later...)

                <p class = "intro">My story with cats starts with Xiaobai. 
                    The meaning of his name is "little white", because when I 
                    adopted him, he was still a 1.5 months little baby. And, 
                    obviously, he is a white cat. I tried to give him some fancy 
                    names like Stanford, but he likes "xiaobai" the most. Adopting Xiaobai 
                    is actually related to America. In the summer of 2015, I went to 
                    Boston to attend my aunt's wedding and I met so many new friends there.
                    However, when I went back home, I was overwhelmed by loneliness. I begged 
                    my parents to allow me to have a cat, they finally approved after me 
                    crying for an hour. Then, I found this photo online, taken by his mom's 
                    owner. He was born on 07/12/2015, we met on 09/29/2015. Until now, in 
                    2024, I still clearly remember the excitement to have him.

                <p class = "intro">Xiaobai was 3 month old in this picture. He 
                    was super scared in the first several days, but he already 
                    adapted the new enviroment then. He was a typical couchpotato, 
                    never slept in his own "home", but slept on couch everyday. 
                    When I look back now, I feel so sad for him, maybe he hated us to 
                    separate him from his family. Also, since he is my first cat, I didn't 
                    really know how to take care of him. He ate dry cat food everyday, no 
                    treats, no can food, and seldom had meat. I was a terrible big sister.

                <p class = "intro">Xiaobai was around 6 month now! This photo 
                    was taken in a sad night where I had a lot of homework. He 
                    sat on my desk and watched me do my homework. We were really 
                    close before he became an adult cat. He stayed with me when I do 
                    my homework, sleep and play all kinds of silly games together. To be 
                    honest, when I wrote the captions for my baby pictures, there was 
                    no emotion involved, I was like describing others' story. But now, I feel 
                    so sad and lonely, I want to travel back to 2015 or 2016 to spend that 
                    wonderful time with Xiaobai again. He was my best friend, I love him.

                    fighting with people or other cats. He spent most of his days sleeping 
                    everywhere and begging for treats. It also makes me sad because Xiaobai 
                    is always a super energetic and naughty cat in my memory. Now, I have to 
                    accept the truth that he is old and he will no longer plays those silly 
                    game with me🥹.

                    and weighs 20 pounds or more. He was a stray and my mom adopted him in the 
                    summer of 2020. But since Xiaobai doesn't like him, I don't like 
                    him. He is more like a family cat than my cat, so I named him Chapter 1.5. 
                    Even though I am not a big fan of him, but I have to admit that he has 
                    very good temper haha!

                    cat's society, licking others' fur means "I am superior than you" 
                    And....Potato licks me a lot. Even though he begs me for food and treats 
                    everyday and if I don't clean his litter box he will have no where to 💩.
