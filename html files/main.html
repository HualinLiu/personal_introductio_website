                     whose meaning is birch forest in mandarin, 
                     isn't it beautiful and unique? When my mom 
                     named me as birch forest, she hoped I can be
                    skinny and tall like a birch tree. Unfortunately,
                     I am only 5'4... But I am skinny!!!!</p>

                    My parents were not happy about my appearance because 
                    I was so dark and hmmm, according to them, ugly. They even thought 
                    the nurse gave them the wrong baby since their skin tones are both light. Anyways,
                    I was 49cm long and 7.4 pounds and born with 3cm long hair.
